# greenprocure

## Overview
GreenProcure is an open-source platform designed to help organizations and businesses make environmentally and socially responsible procurement decisions. Our goal is to promote sustainable practices and support suppliers with strong ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings.

## Features
- **Supplier Evaluation**: Database of suppliers with detailed ESG ratings, including metrics like carbon footprint, waste management, and labor practices.
- **Sustainable Product Recommendations**: Integration with existing procurement systems to suggest eco-friendly alternatives.
- **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Calculate the carbon footprint of procurement choices and offer suggestions to reduce emissions.
- **Transparency and Reporting**: Detailed reports on procurement activities focused on ESG metrics, with visualizations to showcase progress.
- **Community and Collaboration**: Platform for sharing best practices, success stories, and collaborating on sustainable procurement initiatives.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Seamless integration with popular procurement and supply chain management software.

## NOTE

- **This is an entirely new initiative.  Lots of behind the scenes planning is still underway.  A portal will be developed in due course that provides more details.
